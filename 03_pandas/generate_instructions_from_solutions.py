"""
This script reads a Jupyter notebook file named "solutions.ipynb", processes its cells, and generates a new notebook file named "instructions.ipynb".
It removes the output from each code cell, checks if the first line of the source code contains the word "solution", and replaces the rest of the lines with a placeholder comment.
The new notebook file is saved in the same directory.
